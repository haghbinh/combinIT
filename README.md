There are several non-functional-form-based interaction tests for testing interaction in unreplicated two-way layouts. However, no single test can detect all patterns of possible interaction and the tests are sensitive to a particular pattern of interaction. This package combines six non-functional-form-based interaction tests for testing additivity. These six tests were proposed by Boik (1993a), Piepho (1994), Kharrati-Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi (2007), Franck et al. (2013), Malik et al. (2016) and Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller (2016). The p-values of these six tests are combined by Bonferroni, Sidak, Jacobi polynomial expansion, and the Gaussian copula methods to provide researchers with a testing approach which leverages many existing methods to detect disparate forms of non-additivity.
