There are several non-functional-form-based interaction tests for testing interaction in unreplicated two-way layouts.
However, no single test can detect all patterns of possible interaction and the tests are sensitive to a particular pattern of interaction.
This package combines six non-functional-form-based interaction tests for testing additivity.


These six tests were proposed by Boik (1993), Piepho (1994), Kharrati-Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi (2007), Franck et al. (2013), Malik et al. (2016)
and Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller (2016). The p-values of these six tests are combined by Bonferroni, Sidak, Jacobi polynomial expansion, and the Gaussian
copula methods to provide researchers with a testing approach which leverages many existing methods to detect disparate forms of non-additivity.
This package is based on the following published paper: Shenavari and Kharrati-Kopaei (2018) 
**A Method for Testing Additivity in Unreplicated Two-Way Layouts Based on Combining Multiple Interaction Tests**. 
In addition, several sentences in help files or descriptions were copied from that paper.
