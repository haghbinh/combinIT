\description{
This function reports the p-values of the tests for non-additivity developed by Boik (1993), Piepho (1994),
Kharrati-Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi (2007), Franck et al. (2013), Malik et al. (2016)
and Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller (2016). In addition, it combines the p-values of these six tests (and some other available p-values) into a single p-value as a test statistic for testing interaction.
There are four combination methods:
Bonferroni, Sidak, Jacobi expansion, and Gaussian Copula. The results of these four combined tests are also reported. If there is a significant interaction, the type of interaction is also provided.
}
\details{
The data matrix is divided based on the row of the data matrix for \code{KKSA.test} and \code{Franck.test}. Note that \code{KKSA.test} is not applicable when \eqn{a} is less than four. \code{Franck.test} and \code{Piepho.test} are not applicable when \eqn{a} is less than three. This function needs \code{mvtnorm} package.
