\usage{
KKSA_test(x, nsim = 10000, Elapsed_time = TRUE)

, respectively.}

\item{nsim}{a numeric value, the number of Monte Carlo samples for computing an exact Monte Carlo p-value. The default value is 10000.}

}
\value{
An object of the class \code{ITtest}, which is a list inducing following components::
\item{pvalue_exact}{The calculated exact Monte Carlo p-value.}
\item{pvalue_appro}{The Bonferroni-adjusted p-value is calculated.}
\item{statistic}{The value of the test statistic.}
\item{Nsim}{The number of Monte Carlo samples that are used to estimate p-value.}

\description{
This function calculates Kharrati-Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi's test statistic and corresponding p-value for testing interaction.
}
\details{
Suppose that \eqn{b>=3} and \eqn{b>=4}. Consider the \eqn{l}-th division of the data table into two sub-tables,
 obtained by putting \eqn{b_1} (\eqn{2<U+2264>b_1<U+2264>b-2}) rows in the first sub-table and the remaining \eqn{b_2} rows in the second sub-table (\eqn{b_1+b_2=a}).
 Let RSS1 and RSS2 denote the residual sum of squares for these two sub-tables, respectively. For a particular division \eqn{l}, let \eqn{F_l=max<U+2061>(F_l,1/F_l }
 where \eqn{F_l=(b_2-1)RSS1/((b_1-1)RSS2)} and let \eqn{P_l} denote the corresponding p-value.
 Kharrati-Kopaei and Sadooghi-Alvandi (2007) proposed their test statistic as the minimum value of \eqn{P_l} over \eqn{l=1,…,2^(b-1)-b-1} all possible divisions of the table.
 Note that if the rows number, \eqn{b}, of data matrix is less than the columns number, \eqn{a}, the data matrix is transposed. In addition, this method of testing requires that the data matrix has more than three
 rows or columns. This test procedure is powerful for detecting interaction when the magnitude of interaction effects is heteroscedastic across the sub-tables of observations.
