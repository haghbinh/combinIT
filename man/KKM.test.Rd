\title{Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller's (2016) Test for Interaction}
\usage{
KKM.test(x, nsim = 1000, nc0 = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix, \eqn{a \times b} data matrix where the number of row and column is corresponding to the number of factor levels.}

\item{nsim}{a numeric value, the number of Monte Carlo samples for computing an exact Monte Carlo p-value. The default value is 10000.}

\item{nc0}{a numeric value, the number of Monte Carlo samples for computing the unbiasing constant \eqn{c_0}. The default value is 10000.}
}
\value{
An object of the class \code{ITtest}, which is a list inducing following components::
\item{pvalue.exact}{The calculated exact Monte Carlo p-value.}
\item{pvalue.appro}{is not available for \code{KKM.test}.}
\item{Nsim}{The number of Monte Carlo samples that are used to estimate p-value.}
\item{statistic}{The value of the test statistic.}
\item{data.name}{The name of the input dataset.}
\item{test}{The name of the test.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the test statistic for testing \eqn{H_0:} There is no interaction, and corresponding Monte Carlo p-value
proposed by Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller(2016).
}
\details{
Kharrati-Kopaei and Miller(2016) proposed a test statistic for testing interaction
based on inspecting all pairwise interaction contrasts (PIC).
This test depends on an unbiasing constant \eqn{c_0} that is calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation.
In addition, the null distribution of the test statistic is calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation. This test is not applicable when both \eqn{a} and \eqn{b} are less than three.
Note that this test procedure is powerful when significant interactions are caused by some data cells.
